Richard's previous projects during internships and in courses at school.



***BC Government Data Assessment***

This project aims to assess the value of the BC Government's property ownership transfer data which is available through a monthly subscription. The goal is to determine whether the insights gained from this data justify the subscription cost for the company. It demonstrates expertise in data handling, analysis, and reporting automation, focusing on Python programming and data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

The project involves reading raw sales data, cleaning and transforming it, and generating comprehensive reports for decision-making. The focus is on building efficient data pipelines, ensuring data integrity, and extracting meaningful insights. This project is designed for scalability and modularity, making it easy to adapt to different types of government or commercial datasets.


***Analysis of Trump's Impact on 2020 US Election ***

This project, completed as part of a data analysis course, focuses on evaluating Donald Trump's impact on the election result as a candidate. The analysis leverages data science techniques to explore trends, sentiments, and other key metrics relevant to Trumpâ€™s campaign performance, public perception, or electoral data.

The project demonstrates my ability to handle large datasets, apply statistical analysis, and extract meaningful insights that support data-driven conclusions. It is a testament to my proficiency in Python, data analysis libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib), and Jupyter Notebooks for conducting in-depth analyses and visualizations.
